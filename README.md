This page has the intention and hope of sparking a community to make just what the name says - an Open-competitor-to-Facebook.

My name's Alexander but I'm no one special here. I dont want to own this project and have no illusions that I can make it happen alone. I have just not found an existing project like this yet to help with and I think people need it.

Foundation: The site must be completely transparent in the way it works and must ultimately be decentralised, meaning out of my hands too. It must also be appealing enough for people that they naturally prefer it to facebook, which I think means it must utilise some sort of deep learning to provide the most appealing possible content for users. We can decide all the details together as we go.

If this sounds good and you can help in any way, please lend a hand. This is for everyone!
